This example demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in TypeScript: implicit type coercion that leads to runtime errors.  The `add` function is declared to accept two numbers, but the call to `add(1, "2")` compiles without errors because TypeScript's type system doesn't fully prevent this coercion.  However, this causes a runtime exception.  The solution involves stricter type checking and potentially using type guards to enforce type safety.
